            Y'all don't know what's about to happen baby
            Team 10
            Los Angeles - Cali boy
            But I'm from Ohio though - white boy
            (Jake Paul...)

            It's everyday bro
            With the Disney Channel flow
            5 mill on YouTube in 6 months
            Never done before
            Passed all the competition man
            PewDiePie is next
            Man I'm popping all these checks
            Got a brand new Rolex
            And I met a Lambo too
            And I'm coming with the crew
            This is Team 10, bitch
            Who the hell are flippin' you?
            And you know I kick them out

            Yeah, I'm talking about you
            You beggin' for attention
            Talking shit on Twitter too
            But you still hit my phone last night
            It was 4:52 and I got the text to prove
            And all the recordings too
            Don't make me tell them the truth
            And I just dropped some new merch
            And it's selling like a God, church
            Ohio's where I'm from
            We chew 'em like it's gum
            We shooting with a gun
            The tattoo just for fun
            I Usain Bolt and run
            Catch me at game one
            I cannot be outdone
            Jake Paul is number one

            Then the US would be shitty
            I'll pass it to Chance
